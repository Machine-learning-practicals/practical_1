# Practical 1 

Keywords: Feature Selection; Regression

In this practical, we predict the efficiency of novel organic photovoltaic molecules. The goal is to find optimial solar cells that are cheap to produce, flexible, transparament, and be made. The Harvard Clean Energy Project conduct an intensive search on potential organic photovoltaics and collect properties of different materials, i.e. the difference in energy between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). With data of one million molecules to train on, we can learning a function from a feature representation of the molecule to the HOMO-LUMO gap to make predictions on other molecules. 

In addition to model selections, one of the challenges of making predictions about molecules is finding a good feature representation. More details can be found in the final report pdf.
